# distributed-Systems
• One server and Three Clients, clients designated a directory to behave as a shared directory over their system, whenever a file is added to any of the clients directory, it will be automatically detected and notified to the other clients and added to their shared directory. • If any client modifies a file in their directory, the update was made in the shared directory as well. • If a file is deleted in any client’s directory, then a vote request was sent, if all the clients vote a ‘yes’, then the delete operation was committed otherwise the file was restored back in the folder from where it was deleted. An additional aspect was that of a timer being added, which if expired then the Server itself would commit the delete operation and the file would be deleted from all the clients. • User-name was to be entered and checked for duplication, then displayed on the Tkinter GUI.
